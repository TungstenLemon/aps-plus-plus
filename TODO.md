# Not Started
- Barrel SKIN property (Can be drawn like entites, preset shapes, custom shapes \[\[]], or not at all)
- Bot class probibilities (Tier 4 tanks have a higher chance of being chosen than Tier 1 for example)
  - Could even go the extra mile and gather some data from observation of most chosen tanks in arras
- Fix bot score not matching up with maximum level up of players
- Atomizer
- Fix getting stuck on refresh :(
- Dreadnought Atmosphere
- IMAGE property in entities that applies a custom image as the body from a link string
- STAR_DIP property which is just dipmulti
- Hex code colors for barrel color and entity color
- Flashing for spawn invuln
- Fix sentries and crashers seemingly being OP
- Fix bots being STUPID
  - let them wander :)
  - and avoid bullets maybe
- Glow Opacity
- NAME_COLOR (so bots can have colored names, key colors take priority)
- dev everything branch, so i can scroll through every tank
- Shoot on death... somehow...
- HOLLOW (for making donuts, its a number that goes from 0 (disabled) to 1 (practically outlines at that point))
- SMOOTH (for turrets, by default it's true, but if turned false it will disable the angular lerp of the turret)
- Fix shapes dying on walls
- Sandbox-like commands
- Make the upgrade tree accurate to the arras one
- Add DEFAULT_UPGRADE_COLOR into class tree, -1 defaults to the current behavior


# In progress

# Finished
- ~~Upgrade Box Colors (UPGRADE_COLOR)~~
- ~~Private permissions (permissions.json to permissions.js)~~
- ~~Fix infestor inaccuracy (all the drones should be controlled)~~
- ~~GLOW, GLOW_STRENGTH, and GLOW_COLOR properties (GLOW could probably be replaced by checking if GLOW_STRENGTH is not 0)~~
